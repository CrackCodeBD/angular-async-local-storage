# Checks before posting an issue

- [ ] I have read all the library's documentation (README, CHANGELOG, MIGRATION and /docs)
- [ ] I understand I am writing to a *human being*, doing this open source project on his *free* time
- [ ] I will be involved in my own issue, by answering questions and informing if the issue is resolved

<!-- Otherwise the issue will be closed. -->

# Description of the issue

<!-- Be precise, a vague description will not allow to find the problem. -->

# How to reproduce the issue

<!-- Hundred of tests are already checking most scenarios work, so without reproduction steps I will not be able to help. -->
