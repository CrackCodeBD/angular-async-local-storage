Hi,

The GitHub "Issues" tab is not intended for questions and support. A new "Discussions" tab, with a [Questions & Answers category](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/angular-async-local-storage/discussions/categories/q-a), is available for that purpose.

Note the author is *unpaid* for his work on this lib and thus will answer based on his availability. [Sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/cyrilletuzi/) is welcomed if you want to dedicated help.
